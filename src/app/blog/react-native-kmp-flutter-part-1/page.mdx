## Introduction: The Cross-Platform Dilemma

A mobile app is a **must-have** for almost every company today. For some, it's their **primary business driver**. Every organization aims to offer a seamless experience on both iOS and Android, and relying solely on a web app often _isn’t enough_.

However, developing two separate apps with shared functionality is both **costly** and **time-consuming**. This is especially challenging for startups and small to medium-sized businesses that need **speed and efficiency** to hit their goals—whether launching an **MVP**, iterating to find _product-market fit_, or scaling up.

Cross-platform solutions like **React Native, Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), and Flutter** solve this problem. Their _"code once, run everywhere"_ approach speeds up development, reduces costs, and makes scaling easier. Even **major tech companies** have embraced this strategy because of its business advantages.

The question then is: **which framework should you use?** The answer, as is often the case, _isn't just a technical one_—**it’s a strategic decision**. This article will help you understand which solution best fits your needs and supports your **business goals**.

## A Brief History and Where We Are Today

React Native was the first of the three to emerge in **2015**. Introduced by **Facebook (Meta)**, it quickly gained steam, mainly because it's based on **React's web development model**, which was and still is a development framework of choice for many front-end web developers. Given that and the impressive ecosystem surrounding React, React Native enjoys a considerable 38% market share.

**Google**'s answer to React Native was the introduction of Flutter in **2017**. Its powerful tooling and commitment to achieving near-native performance have pushed it past React Native. Over time, Flutter expanded beyond mobile to **web, desktop, and embedded platforms**, becoming a full-stack UI toolkit and it currently leads the cross-platform market with a 42% adoption rate.

In that same year, **2017** saw **JetBrains**, the authors of the Kotlin programming language, announcing their cross-platform framework, Kotlin Multiplatform. Designed to integrate seamlessly with **existing native applications**, making it attractive for enterprises. However, since it only became production-ready in late 2023, it has a corresponding small market share of around 2%.

## The Technology Behind Each Framework: How Do They Work?

Before diving into how these frameworks work, it helps to first clarify **what they are not**. They are **not** designed for building web or hybrid mobile apps like **Cordova** or **Ionic**.

The latter rely heavily on front-end web technologies such as HTML, Javascript, and CSS and render their content in a **web browser**, which can limit performance and the overall user experience.

In contrast, the cross-platform frameworks being discussed here-**React Native, Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), and Flutter**-help developers build **fully native apps**.

<a id="item-3.1"></a>
### How Are These Different?

In a fully native approach, the **UI components are rendered directly by the operating system**. There is no browser, just a fully native experience. There’s _no embedded web browser_, just a seamless, platform-native experience.

Each framework takes a **unique approach** to achieving this, but they all rely on:

- A **dedicated programming language**
- A **specific development workflow**
- A **set of tools** that enable deployment across multiple platforms

<a id="item-3.2"></a>
### What This Means For Startups & Teams

Not surprisingly, all three frameworks vary in **architecture, strengths, and trade-offs**. The right choice depends on factors like development speed, scalability, and team expertise. **Startups and engineering teams** looking to adopt cross-platform development need to evaluate **which framework best aligns with their goals**.

<a id="item-3.3"></a>
### React Native: Javascript and Native Bridge

**React Native** is built on **React**, allowing developers to use **JavaScript and JSX** (or **TypeScript and TSX**) to create native mobile apps. The development process feels **very similar** to building a web application.

A core feature of React Native is its **declarative UI approach**. Developers assemble **reusable UI components**, making it easier to build **dynamic, responsive interfaces** that run on both **iOS and Android** using **native UI components and APIs**.

For example, a **\<View\>** in **React Native** maps to a **ViewGroup** on Android to a **UIView** on iOS.

One of React Native’s **biggest advantages** is its ability to share a **significant amount of functionality** across platforms. This includes:

- **UI components** that work on both iOS and Android.
- **Business logic** written in JavaScript, reducing the need for platform-specific code.

However, React Native **relies on a JavaScript bridge** to communicate with **native modules** for rendering and executing logic. This extra step **introduces overhead**, which can lead to latency issues. Because of this, React Native apps **cannot match the performance** of fully native applications. Over time, Meta invested in improving performance (**Hermes engine, Fabric architecture**), but the JS bridge remains a challenge.

### Flutter: A Custom Rendering Engine

**Flutter** takes a similar approach to **React Native's** strategy of implementing **UI and business logic once** and applying it across all targeted platforms.

However, unlike React Native, which uses the **OS’s native UI elements**, Flutter **renders everything from scratch** using a **dedicated rendering engine (Skia)**. This gives Flutter **full control** over how the UI looks and behaves, ensuring a **consistent user experience** across platforms. In a way, Flutter works more like a **game engine**, drawing everything itself rather than relying on platform-specific components.

Flutter uses the **Dart programming language** to implement both **UI and business logic**. Since it owns the **entire rendering stack**, Flutter apps run **incredibly close** to **fully native performance**. This level of control allows for smooth animations, fast load times, and a highly responsive user interface.

<a id="item-3.5"></a>
### KMP: Native Business Logic, Separate UI

Compared to **React Native** and **Flutter, Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** takes a **different approach**. Instead of sharing both **UI and business logic**, KMP focuses primarily on **business logic**, while leaving the **UI to be handled natively** on each platform. _This makes it fundamentally different from React Native and Flutter, which aim to unify UI development as well_.

As the name suggests, **Kotlin** is the programming language used to develop the **shared functionality**. This shared code can then be added to a native app as a **dependency**, allowing teams to reuse business logic without modifying the UI layer. **With this approach, developers maintain full control over the user experience on iOS and Android** while benefiting from code reusability on the backend.

KMP compiles to **native Kotlin** for Android and **Kotlin Native** for iOS. Since there’s no extra runtime or intermediary bridge, the code runs **directly on the native platform**, ensuring better performance compared to frameworks that rely on JavaScript bridges.

Because of its **modular nature, KMP can be integrated into existing apps** without requiring a complete rewrite. This makes it an excellent option for companies that want to **introduce cross-platform functionality gradually**, rather than committing to a full migration upfront.

_Note: Compose Multiplatform has not been included in this article since iOS support is still only in beta at the time of writing._
